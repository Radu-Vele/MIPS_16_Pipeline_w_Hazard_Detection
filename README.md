# MIPS 16 Pipeline with Hazard Detection and Avoidance

## About
> This repo contains a VHDL implementation of a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) Pipeline. As an addition it contains components for handling Data and Control Hazards

## How to run the project
The source code was tested using [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html). It includes a testbench that can be simulated. For adding a custom program, modify the curr_rom content in IF_unit.vhd.

### Encoding of the instruction fields
